The Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries.",

A common historiography of the conflict begins with 1946, the year U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan's 'Long Telegram' from Moscow cemented a U.S. foreign policy of containment of Soviet expansionism threatening strategically vital regions, and ending between the Revolutions of 1989 and the 1991 collapse of the USSR, which ended communism in Eastern Europe. The term 'cold' is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, but they each supported major regional wars known as proxy wars.",

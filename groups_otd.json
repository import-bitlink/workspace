Kennan's 'Long Telegram' from Moscow cemented a U.S. foreign policy of containment of Soviet expansionism threatening strategically vital regions, and ending between the Revolutions of 1989 and the 1991 collapse of the USSR, which ended communism in Eastern Europe. The term 'cold' is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, but they each supported major regional wars known as proxy wars.",
